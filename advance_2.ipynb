    "PDF stands for Probability Density Function. It is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.

Each item in the batch is inspected independently, and there is a constant probability of a defective item being produced. The Binomial distribution can help assess the likelihood of specific numbers of defective items in the batch.\n"
